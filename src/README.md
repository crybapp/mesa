## Info
`@cryb/mesa` is a wrapper around the [ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws) library that provides extra features ontop of WebSockets such as Heartbeats and Redis Pub/Sub.

`ws` on its own is incredibly bare. It doesn't provide support for high throughput modern applications such as scaling support, heartbeats, reconnection acks. Furthermore, many applications have to write their own implementations for user authentication while using WebSockets.

Mesa was written to provide a robust solution to this. Modeled after Discord's WebSockets, Mesa was first utilised in `@cryb/api`. After a while we wanted to expand our microservices utilising the robust WebSocket solution we had instilled in `@cryb/api`. Thus, Mesa was born.

In a nutshell, Mesa provides a simple wrapper that provides support for pub/sub, authentication, heartbeats and more.

### Features
* Pub/sub support via Redis
* Heartbeat support
* Reconnection support
* Authentication support

#### Planned Features
* Message sync support
* Plugin / middleware support
* Better disconnection handling

### Opcodes
Mesa relies on opcodes to identify different event types. While internal Mesa events uses opcodes 1 to 22, these may be useful to know for building a custom client for example.

We recommend that you keep to opcode 0 for sending / recieving events via Mesa to minimalise errors and interference with internal Mesa events.

| **Code** | **Name**           | **Client Action** | **Description**                                                                          |
|----------|--------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0        | Dispatch           | Send/Receive      | Sent by both Mesa and the client to transfer events                                      |
| 1        | Heartbeat          | Send/Recieve      | Sent by both Mesa and the client for ping checking                                       |
| 2        | Authentication     | Send              | Sent by the client to authenticate with Mesa                                             |
| 10       | Hello              | Recieve           | Sent by Mesa alongside server information for client setup                               |
| 11       | Heartbeat ACK      | Receive           | Sent by Mesa to acknowledge a heartbeat has been received                                |
| 22       | Authentication ACK | Receive           | Sent by Mesa alongside user information to acknowledge the client has been authenticated |

## Installation
This library is available on the [NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cryb/mesa). To install, run:
```bash
npm i @cryb/mesa --save
```
If you're using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), run:

```bash
yarn add @cryb/mesa
```

## Usage
### Server Side
Import the library as you would with any other Node package:
```js
const Mesa = require('@cryb/mesa')
// or using ES modules
import Mesa from '@cryb/mesa'
```

To create a Mesa server, simply write:
```js
const server = new Mesa({ port: 4000 })
```

We provide expansive configuration support for customising Mesa to your needs. Here's a rundown of options we provide:
```ts
{
    // Optional: port that Mesa should listen on. Defaults to 4000
    port: number
    // Optional: namespace for Redis events. If you have multiple Mesa instances running on a cluster, you should use this
    namespace: string

    // Optional: allow Mesa to use an already established HTTP server for listening
    server: http.Server | https.Server
    // Optional: support for pub/sub via Redis
    redis: Redis.RedisOptions | string

    // Optional
    heartbeat?: {
        // Enable / disable heartbeats. Defaults to false
        enabled: boolean

        // Optional: interval in ms for how often heartbeats should be sent to clients. Defaults to 10000ms
        interval: number
        // Optional: how many heartbeats Mesa should send before closing the connection. Defaults to 3
        maxAttempts: number
    }
    // Optional
    reconnect?: {
        // Enable / disconnect reconnects. Defaults to false
        enabled: boolean

        // Optional: interval in ms for how often a client should try to reconnect once disconnected from a Mesa server. Defaults to 5000ms
        interval?: number
    }

    // Optional
    authentication?: {
        // Optional: interval in ms for how long a client has to send authentication data before being disconnected from a Mesa server. Defaults to 10000ms
        timeout?: number

        // Optional: send the user object to the client once authentication is complete. Defaults to true
        sendUserObject?: boolean
        // Optional: disconnect the user if authentication failed. Defaults to true
        disconnectOnFail?: boolean
    }
}
```

Mesa uses EventEmitter in order to inform the application of events. Here's an example of a simple Mesa application:
```js
mesa.on('connection', client => {
    console.log('Client connected')

    client.on('message', message => {
        const { data, type } = message

        console.log('Recieved', data, type)
    })

    client.on('disconnect', (code, reason) => {
        console.log('Client disconnected')
    })
})
```

From here, everything should be fairly self explanatory. We'll share more guides once we implement more features for Mesa.

#### Authenticating Clients
Mesa supports client authentication through a simple API that can adapt to support your authentication infrastructure. To authenticate a user from Mesa, use the following API:

```js
const server = new Mesa({
    port: 4000,
    namespace: 'api', // Optional: supply a namespace so different Mesa servers running on a cluster don't interfere with each other
    redis: 'redis://localhost:6379' // Optional: supply a Redis URI to make full use of Authentication via Pub/Sub
})

mesa.on('connection', client => {
    // When a client connects and sends an authentication message, it can be handled here.
    // This authentication method takes in a callback that is called with two parameters: data (sent from the client) and done (supplied by Mesa).
    // This method is called when a client sends a opcode 2 message. For example, it would look like {"op": 2, d: { "token": ... }}
    client.authenticate(async ({ token }, done) => {
        try {
            // Once authentication data has been supplied from the client message, you can authenticate via a call to a microservice or database lookup
            const { data: user } = await axios.post('http://localhost:4500', { token }),
                    { info: { id } } = user

            // Once you have authenticated the user, call the done method supplied in the callback with two parameters.
            // The first parameter should be an error incase there was an issue authenticating this user. If there was no issue, supply null.
            // The second parameter should be an object containing the user ID and the user object. The user ID will be used for Redis Pub/Sub and will ...
            // ... be available in the client.id property. If there was an error, do not supply this value or simply supply null
            done(null, { id, user })
        } catch(error) {
            // Feel free to use a try/catch to resolve done with an error
            done(error)
        }
    })
})
```

Our use of Redis Pub/Sub relies on a client being authenticated. If you haven't authenticated your client Mesa will not make use of Pub/Sub with this client. Other authenticated clients will have their messages proxied by Pub/Sub

### Client Side
We currently provide a client interface for JavaScript. We're working on client implementations for Swift and other languages.

#### <a name="client-authentication"></a> JavaScript
Import the Client export from the library as you would with any other Node package:
```js
const { Client } = require('@cryb/mesa')
// or using ES modules
import { Client } from '@cryb/mesa'
```

To connect to a Mesa server, simply write:
```js
const client = new Client('ws://localhost:4000')
```
*Note: the URL provided needs to be the standard WebSocket connection URI for your Mesa server*

We provide expansive configuration support for customising Mesa to your needs. Here's a rundown of options we provide:
```ts
{
    // Optional: enable/disable auto connection to the Mesa server once the client object has been instantiated. Enabled by default. Once disabled, use the 'connect()' method in order to connect the client to the Mesa server
    autoConnect?: boolean
}
```

To provide these options, instantiate the client object like this:
```js
const client = new Client('ws://localhost:4000', {
    // Options go here
})
```

We use the EventEmitter in order to inform the application of events from the Mesa server. Here's an example of a simple client application:
```js
const client = new Client('ws://localhost:4000')

client.on('connection', () => {
    console.log('Client connected')
})

client.on('message', message => {
    const { data, type } = message

    console.log('Recieved', data, type)
})

client.on('disconnected', (code, reason) => {
    console.log('Client disconnected')
})
```

##### Authentication
Mesa interacts with the server in order to authenticate the client using a simple API. In order to authenticate with the server, you can use the `authenticate()` API. See the following example:
```js
const client = new Client('ws://localhost:4000')

client.on('connection', async () => {
    console.log('Client connected')

    const { user } = await client.authenticate({ token: fetchToken() })
    console.log(`Hello ${user.name}!`)
})
```
