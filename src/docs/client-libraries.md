# Client Libraries
While we have an official Client implementation for Node.js in this repository, we do offer client libraries for other languages.

Here's a list of official or community maintained client libraries:
* [mesa-js-client](https://github.com/neoncloth/mesa-js-client) for browser-based JavaScript. Maintained by William from Cryb
* [mesa-react-native](https://github.com/seshchat/mesa-react-native) for React Native. Maintained by the SESH team

## Creating a Client Library
We'd love for the community to create implementations of the Mesa client. Make sure to title the library in the style of `mesa-lang-client`. For example, a Go library would take the name of `mesa-go-client`.

In the future we'll publish a specification so it's easier to understand how the client interacts with a Mesa server, but for now please look over [`client.ts`](https://github.com/crybapp/mesa/blob/master/src/client/index.ts). If you do create a client library, please let us know [on our Discord](https://discord.gg/ShTATH4)

## Future Libraries
We'd love to see client implementations of Mesa in the all languages, but these are the languages we have our eye onâ€”ordered by priority:

* [Swift](https://swift.org)
* [Go](https://golang.org)
